Wine Quality data set is taken from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality

Abstract: Two datasets are included, related to red and white vinho verde wine samples, from the north of Portugal. The goal is to model wine quality based on physicochemical tests

Data Set Information: The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.

These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So it could be interesting to test feature selection methods.

In the file statistics.ipynb wine quality data set will be used for t-test of some characteristics and for statistic models such as multiple and logistic regression.
